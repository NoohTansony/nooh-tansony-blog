AI content is everywhere.
Useful AI content for builders is not.

The real edge is simple: **follow fewer sources, but follow first-hand sources consistently.**

This list is curated for developer productivity, not hype.

---

## Selection Criteria

I use four filters when choosing sources:

1. **Originality** — Is this first-hand work from teams/people building the thing?
2. **Reproducibility** — Can I test it (code, setup details, benchmarks)?
3. **Consistency** — Is this source useful over time, not just once?
4. **Developer fit** — Can I apply it directly to products and workflows?

## 1) Official Technical Blogs You Should Pin First

### 1) OpenAI (Blog / Docs / Cookbook)
- Fastest place to catch model and API updates.
- Especially useful for structured outputs, tool/function calling, eval patterns, and agent workflows.

### 2) Anthropic (News / Docs)
- Strong perspective on long-context usage, safe tool integration, and agentic systems.
- Great for system-level design, not just prompt tweaks.

### 3) Google DeepMind / Google Developers (AI)
- Valuable for multimodal product direction and research-to-product translation.
- Helpful when you care about real-world deployment constraints.

### 4) Meta AI
- Essential for keeping up with open-weight ecosystem momentum (including Llama-related progress).
- Good signal on model efficiency and open infrastructure direction.

### 5) Microsoft Research + Azure AI Blog
- Strong on enterprise adoption, governance, and production architecture.
- Practical if your work involves team-scale deployment and compliance.

## 2) Individual Blogs That Are Especially Useful for Developers

### 1) Simon Willison
- High-signal experiments on LLM tooling, evals, and practical implementation patterns.
- Clear writing and fast iteration logs make it very reusable.

### 2) Lilian Weng
- Deep dives on core topics like agents, reasoning, and retrieval.
- Excellent bridge between papers and real implementation decisions.

### 3) Sebastian Raschka
- Strong code-first content from fundamentals to fine-tuning workflows.
- Great material for team learning and internal study sessions.

### 4) Jay Alammar
- Still one of the best at visual explanations of transformers/LLMs.
- Perfect for onboarding and concept alignment across teams.

### 5) Hugging Face Blog
- High velocity updates across models, datasets, and inference optimization.
- A strong pulse check for open-source AI tooling.

## 3) High-Signal X Accounts to Follow

Prioritize accounts with implementation context over viral takes.

- <https://x.com/karpathy> (Andrej Karpathy)
- <https://x.com/simonw> (Simon Willison)
- <https://x.com/rasbt> (Sebastian Raschka)
- <https://x.com/ylecun> (Yann LeCun)
- <https://x.com/AndrewYNg> (Andrew Ng)
- <https://x.com/OpenAI>
- <https://x.com/AnthropicAI>
- <https://x.com/GoogleAI>
- <https://x.com/huggingface>
- <https://x.com/LangChainAI>

**Tip:** Don’t rely on the default algorithmic feed.
Use Lists instead, at minimum:
- AI-Research
- AI-Engineering
- AI-Product

This alone dramatically reduces noise.

---

## 4) What About Threads?

Threads is improving, but for deeply technical AI dev updates, it is still usually a secondary channel compared to X + official blogs.

Where Threads is useful:
- Industry sentiment and perspective shifts
- Product commentary and ecosystem narratives
- Founder/PM-level interpretation of trends

Practical split:
- **Primary technical signal:** official blogs + X + GitHub releases
- **Secondary context signal:** Threads

---

## 5) Your Reading System Matters More Than Your Source List

Even with great sources, passive reading won’t move your projects.
You need an execution loop.

### Recommended Weekly Routine
- **Daily (20 min):** scan official blogs + X Lists
- **Twice a week (40 min):** reproduce one idea end-to-end
- **Once a week (30 min):** pick one item to integrate into your product

### Quick Capture Template
- Link
- 3-line summary
- 1 application idea
- 1 risk/limitation
- Planned experiment date

## 6) Minimal “Start Today” Follow Set (10)

If you want a lightweight setup, start here:

1. OpenAI Blog
2. Anthropic Blog
3. Google AI/DeepMind Blog
4. Hugging Face Blog
5. Azure AI Blog
6. Simon Willison
7. Lilian Weng
8. Sebastian Raschka
9. Jay Alammar
10. Andrej Karpathy (X)

This set filters out most hype and keeps your feed implementation-focused.

---

## Closing

In AI, your advantage is not volume of information.
It’s **resolution of information**.

- Verify facts via official sources
- Translate ideas via hands-on developer blogs
- Add context via X/Threads

Run that loop consistently, and you’ll stay both current and practical.
